        INTERPRETACIÓN EXPERTA:
        - If the Principal Component Percentage is < 95%, it means that a significant portion of the delivery points are not connected to the main body, requiring a data quality inspection or confirmation that these are isolated systems.
        - Average Density indicates the redundancy of the network, if a low value <1.5 may suggest a topology closer to a tree or radial network.
        - Standard Deviation: A high value implies a heterogeneous network (few nodes control connectivity).
        - Gamma (gamma): Measures how “close” your network is to being a complete graph. In distributed networks, this value will be extremely low (close to zero) due to the radial or branched topology.
        - The lower the percentage of articulation points in a network, the more robust the network.
