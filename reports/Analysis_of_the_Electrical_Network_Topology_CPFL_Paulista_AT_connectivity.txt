        -----------------------------------------------------
        EXPERT INTERPRETATION:
        - LCC Coverage Percentage: If this is < 95%, it implies a significant
          portion of assets are not connected to the main grid. This could
          indicate data quality issues or confirm the existence of
          many independent, isolated systems.
        
        - Average Density: Indicates network redundancy. A value < 1.5
          suggests a topology closer to a tree or radial network (low
          redundancy). MT networks are often slightly > 1.5, while
          BT networks are almost exactly 1.0.

        - Std. Deviation of Degree: A high value implies a heterogeneous
          network (i.e., connectivity is controlled by a few very
          large hubs), which is typical for utility networks.

        - Gamma Index: Measures how "close" the network is to being a
          complete graph. In sparse utility networks (radial or
          branched), this value will be extremely low (near zero).
          
        - Articulation Points: These are the network's critical weak points.
          The lower the percentage of articulation points, the more
          robust (redundant) the network is against node failures. A
          perfect (but non-existent) radial network would have
          almost all non-leaf nodes as articulation points.
